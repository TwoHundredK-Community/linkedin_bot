  - `/set-job-filters` (keywords, locations, companies, remote/hybrid)
  - `/set-job-channel` (specify where job listings should be posted)
- Store previously posted job listings to **avoid duplicates**.
- Schedule job scraping at regular intervals.

### **Phase 4: Trending LinkedIn Topics (Optional)**
- Implement a **scraper for trending LinkedIn posts**.
- Identify **high-engagement posts** from tech and job-seeking categories.
- Implement an admin command to **set frequency (daily/weekly)**.
- Implement an admin command to **set the target Discord channel**.
- Format and post trending topics to Discord.

### **Phase 5: Testing & Deployment**
- **Unit testing**: Validate bot commands and scheduled tasks.
- **Integration testing**: Ensure smooth interaction between **Discord API and LinkedIn API**.
- **Deploy the bot on a cloud server** (AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku).
- Set up **logging and error handling** for debugging and maintenance.

- Offer premium features (e.g., **multiple company tracking, advanced filters, priority alerts**) for paid users.

### 2. **SaaS Subscription Model**
- Host a managed version of the bot with:
  - **Monthly & yearly subscription plans**.
  - **Different pricing tiers** based on usage (e.g., number of LinkedIn pages, job filters, and updates per day).

### 3. **Custom Deployments for Enterprises**
- Offer **self-hosted solutions** for businesses with premium support.
- Provide **custom integration services** for large companies needing advanced job scrapers and alerts.

### 4. **Affiliate & Partner Program**
- Partner with **job boards, recruitment firms, and career platforms**.
- Offer a **commission-based model** for job postings and referrals.

### 5. **Marketplace Listing & Promotion**
- List the bot on **Top.gg**, **Discord Bot List**, and other bot marketplaces.
- Promote on **LinkedIn, Discord communities, and tech forums**.

## **Deployment & Hosting Options**
- **Cloud Platforms**:
  - AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean Droplet / Heroku / Railway.app
- **Railway.app Deployment Strategy**:
  1. **Service Architecture**:
     - Frontend (React): Static site deployment
     - Backend (FastAPI): Python service
     - Database: PostgreSQL instance
     - Redis: Cache and queue management

  2. **Deployment Setup**:
     ```bash
     # Railway CLI commands
     railway login
     railway init
     railway link # Link to your project
     railway up   # Deploy your project
     ```

  3. **Environment Configuration**:
     - Use Railway's environment variables for:
       - Database credentials
       - Discord bot token
       - API keys and secrets
       - Frontend API URLs
